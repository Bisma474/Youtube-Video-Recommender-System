# ðŸŽ¬ YouTube Video Recommender System  

A **content-based recommender system** built with Python that suggests YouTube videos based on similarity in titles, tags, and descriptions. It uses **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity** to generate relevant recommendations and handles large datasets efficiently with sparse matrices.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features  
- Recommends videos based on user input (title or keywords)  
- Uses **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity** for text-based recommendations  
- Handles large datasets using sparse matrix representation  
- Simple result visualization with Python libraries  

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ðŸ“Œ How It Works  
1. Load and preprocess the YouTube dataset (titles, tags, descriptions).  
2. Convert text into numerical features using **TF-IDF**.  
3. Calculate similarity scores with **Cosine Similarity**.  
4. Return the top recommended videos.
